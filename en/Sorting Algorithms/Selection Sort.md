# Selection Sort

#### Problem Statement

Given an unsorted array of n elements, write a function to sort the array

#### Approach

- select the smallest element from the array
- put it at the beginning of the array
- then select the smallest array from the remaining unsorted list
- append it to the sorted array at the beginning
- keep doing this for every element of the array
- repeat the above process n times

#### Time Complexity

`O(n^2)` Worst case performance

`O(n^2)` Best-case performance

`O(n^2)` Average performance

#### Space Complexity

`O(1)` Worst case

#### Example

```
arr[] = {80, 10, 40, 30}
Indexes: 0   1   2   3    

1. Index = 0
	Select the minimum number from the array (between index 0-3), ie, 10
2. Swap 10  and 80 (arr[0])
3. The array now is {10, 80, 40, 30}

4. Index = 1
	Select the minimum number from the array (between index 1-3), ie, 30
5. Swap 30 and 80 (arr[1])
6. The array now is {10, 30, 40, 80}

7. Index = 2
	Select the minimum number from the array (between index 2-3), ie, 40
8. Swap 40 and 40 (arr[2])
9. The array now is {10, 30, 40, 80}

The array is now sorted.
