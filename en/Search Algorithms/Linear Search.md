# Linear Search

#### Problem Statement

Given an array of n elements, write a function to search for the index of a given element (target)

#### Approach

- Start iterating with the first element in the array.
- Compare it with the target element
- If it is equal to the target element then return the index
- Else continue iterating
- Return -1 if target element is not found in the array

#### Time Complexity

O(n) Worse Case     
O(1) Best Case (If first element of array is the target element)

#### Space Complexity

O(1)

#### Example

```
arr = [1, 3, 9, 5, 0, 2]  

target = 5
Linear Search should return index 3 as 5 is on index 3     

target = 6           
Linear Search should return -1 as 6 is not present in the array
```
