# Graphs

Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of 2 main elements - Vertices and Edge. It is formally denoted as G(V,E), where G graph is a set of vertices V and edges E. 
The **vertices** are also known as nodes which are interconnected to each other through **edges**. Graphs are represented in 2 major ways in the code - 
* Adjacency Matrix: The graph is stored in a form of 2D matrix where rows and columns are vertices and each entry represents a connection between them
* Adjacency List: The graph is stored as a collection of linked lists, where each array pointer points to the edges it connects to
