# Stack

Stack is a basic linear data structure which follows an order in which operations are perfomed.The order is called LIFO(Last In First Out)or FILO.
A perfect example for a stack of plates in a canteen,a pile of books,a box of pringles.
Stacks are used to implement parsers and evalution expressions and backtracking algorithms. basic operations are pushing an element into stack and popping the element out of the stack.
We can make use of linked lists or arrays of lists. The stack contains only one pointer
"top pointer" which points to the top most elements of the stack.Insertion and deletion occurs at only one end of the stack.
Some Standard Stack Operations are:
push() : inserts the element at the top of the stack.
pop(): When we delete the element at the top of the stack
isEmpty():It determines whether the stack is empty.
isFull():determines the stack is full or not
